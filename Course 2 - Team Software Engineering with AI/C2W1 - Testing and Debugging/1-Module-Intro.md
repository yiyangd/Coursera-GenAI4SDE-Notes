The importance of software testing can't be overstated.  
软件测试的重要性无可厚非。  

It's a fundamental step in the development process that ensures that you launch high quality, correctly functioning products that result in great experiences for your users.  
它是开发过程中一个基本步骤，确保您发布高质量、正常运行的产品，从而为用户带来良好的体验。  

As a software developer, you can really help keep the wheels of your project turning if you think about software testing and the needs of your testing colleagues at every stage of your work.  
作为一名软件开发人员，如果您在工作每个阶段都考虑到软件测试及测试同事的需求，您将有助于让项目顺利推进。  

Luckily, you can now use an LLM as a partner to do this, even when the software testers might be busy with other projects.  
幸运的是，即使软件测试人员可能忙于其他项目，您现在可以使用大语言模型（LLM）作为合作伙伴来完成这一工作。  

Being more familiar with the discipline of software testing as a whole will help you be a better colleague, save you time, reduce bugs, and improve the overall quality of your code.  
熟悉整个软件测试领域将帮助您成为更好的同事，节省时间，减少漏洞，并提高代码的整体质量。  

Without proper testing, you risk releasing software that could fail in unpredictable ways, leading to frustrated users, potential financial losses, or worse.  
如果没有适当的测试，您可能会发布以不可预测方式失败的软件，这会导致用户沮丧、潜在的财务损失，甚至更严重的后果。

A famous example of a dramatic software failure is the Mars climate orbiter.  
一个著名的软件失败案例是火星气候探测器事件。  

After it launched in 1998 and successfully traveled over 100 million kilometers to Mars, the probe missed its target orbital altitude by just a few kilometers.  
该探测器于1998年发射并成功飞行超过一亿公里到达火星，但仅因几公里的误差而未能达到目标轨道高度。  

The root cause: a simple unit conversion error between the software created by different teams.  
根本原因是不同团队开发的软件之间的一个简单单位转换错误。  

One team used metric units, and the other used imperial units.  
一个团队使用了公制单位，而另一个团队使用了英制单位。  

This mismatch caused the spacecraft to deviate from its intended trajectory, and it ultimately disintegrated in the Martian atmosphere.  
这种不匹配导致航天器偏离预定轨迹，最终在火星大气层中解体。  

This small coding error resulted in the loss of a $200,000,000 mission and years of amazing scientific discoveries, and it could have been caught with more thorough testing.  
这一小小的编码错误导致了耗资两亿美元的任务失败以及多年的科学发现损失，而这一问题本可以通过更全面的测试发现。  

Over the next few videos, you'll explore the importance of testing and debugging and the various types of tests that you can implement in the context of simple applications.  
在接下来的视频中，您将探索测试和调试的重要性以及在简单应用场景中可以实施的各种测试类型。  

You'll start by exploring several different types of manual testing, including exploratory and functional testing.  
您将首先探索几种不同类型的手动测试，包括探索性测试和功能性测试。  

You'll learn how to implement these tests with the help of large language models.  
您将学习如何借助大语言模型实施这些测试。  

Next, you're going to dive into automated testing frameworks.  
接下来，您将深入了解自动化测试框架。  

One of the things I've continually encountered and experienced during my career is that the cognitive load of trying to figure out test scripts and test cases to get the most out of an automated tool can sometimes lead to them being ignored.  
在我的职业生涯中，我经常遇到并体会到这样一个问题：为充分利用自动化工具而努力设计测试脚本和测试用例的认知负担有时会导致这些工具被忽视。  

If that's you, then I would really encourage you to spend some time on this lesson in particular, because working alongside an LLM can be enormously helpful there.  
如果您也遇到这种情况，我建议您花一些时间专注于本课，因为与大语言模型合作可以在这方面提供巨大帮助。  

After that, you're going to explore performance testing, and you'll see how you can work with an AI to ensure that our application performs really well under different conditions and loads.  
之后，您将探索性能测试，并了解如何利用人工智能确保我们的应用程序在不同条件和负载下表现出色。  

Finally, you'll look at techniques to use an LLM to identify and fix security vulnerabilities in your software, and it will help you have productive conversations with your security expert colleagues.  
最后，您将了解如何使用大语言模型识别并修复软件中的安全漏洞，这将帮助您与安全专家同事进行更高效的交流。  

There's a whole lot of exciting stuff to consider here.  
这里有许多令人兴奋的内容值得探讨。  

Let's go onto the next video and get started by looking at testing strategies.  
让我们进入下一个视频，开始了解测试策略吧。
