## Course Description
In this course, you'll elevate your software development skills by learning how to leverage AI in collaborative team environments. You'll discover how to use large language models (LLMs) to streamline testing processes, create comprehensive documentation, and manage complex dependencies.

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Utilize LLMs to generate and implement various types of software tests, from exploratory to security testing
- Create clear, useful documentation that follows best practices and language-specific conventions
- Use AI to explore and manage software dependencies, including resolving conflicts and addressing security issues
- Debug common dependency-related problems with AI as your pair-programmer

These skills will enhance your ability to work effectively in development teams, improve code quality, and streamline the software development lifecycle. By learning AI-assisted collaboration techniques, you'll become a more valuable asset to any development team and be better prepared to tackle complex, real-world software engineering challenges.
